### Aztec barretenberg

#### Transcript for inner cirucit

The rollup circuit uses blake2s to generate the challenge, but with compressed input by pedersen hash [^barretenberg-transcript]. The inputs are serialized into a list of 31 bytes field elements as the input of pedersen hash.

Also the rollup circuit use 128-bits challenge to reduce MSM work, then most of scalars are 128-bits, only those scalars multiplied with some other stuff (e.g. \\(\zeta\omega^i\\) or batch evaluation) would need 254-bits MSM.

#### Public inputs of inner circuit

Barretenberg handles the public inputs along with permutation argument [^barretenberg-permutation-widget]. Its constraint system implicitly copies \\(m\\) public inputs \\(p\\) to first \\(m\\) witness of the first column, and because the public inputs' contribution \\(\frac{1}{\delta}\\) to the grand product is easy to compute, so it doesn't need to evaluate public inputs poly at \\(\zeta\\). Instead, it verifies grand product's final value is the contribution \\(\delta\\).

$$
\frac{1}{\delta} = \prod_{i\in[m]}\left(\frac{p_i + \beta\omega^i + \gamma}{p_i + \beta k_{p}\omega^i + \gamma}\right)
$$

The actual verifier doesn't calculate the \\(\frac{1}{\delta}\\) for inner circuit, it just concatenates all the public inputs and let rollup circuit to calculate \\(\frac{1}{\delta}\\) for each inner circuit.

## Calculations

### Interpolation

#### Barycentric formula [^barycentric-formula]

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell(x) = (x-x_0)(x-x_1)\cdots(x-x_k) \\
& \ell^\prime(x_j) = \frac{d\ell(x)}{dx}\rvert_{x=x_j} = \prod_{i=0,i\ne j}^k(x_j-x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

We can rewrite Lagrange basis as

$$
\ell_j(x) = \frac{\ell(x)}{\ell^\prime(x_j)(x-x_j)}
$$

Or by defining the _barycentric weights_

$$
w_j = \frac{1}{\ell^\prime(x_j)}
$$

Then given evaluations $\{y_i\}_{i\in[k]} = \{f(x_i)\}_{i\in[k]}$ of polynomial \\(f\\), the interpolation of \\(f\\) now can be evaluated as

$$
f(x) = \ell(x) \sum_{j=0}^k\frac{w_j}{x-x_j}y_j
$$

Which, if the weights \\(w_j\\) can be pre-computed, requires only \\(\mathcal{O}(k)\\) as opposed to \\(\mathcal{O}(k^2)\\) for evaluating the Lagrange basis \\(\ell_j(x)\\) individually.

We can furthers simplify it by considering the barycentric interpolation of the constant function \\(g(x) = 1\\)

$$
g(x) = 1 = \ell(x) \sum_{j=0}^k\frac{w_j}{x-x_j}
$$

Divigin \\(f(x)\\) by \\(g(x) = 1\\) doesn't modify the interpolation, yet yields

$$
f(x) = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^k\frac{w_j}{x-x_j}y_j}{\sum_{j=0}^k\frac{w_j}{x-x_j}}
$$

Then we don't even need to evaluate \\(\ell(x)\\).

#### Interpolation of rotation set

Defining rotation set \\(R\\) contains \\(k\\) different points \\(\{\zeta_1\omega_j\}_{j\in[k]}\\), where \\(\zeta_1\\) is the challenge opening point, and \\(\omega_i\\) are the generator to some power (a.k.a rotation).

> Not sure if all arguments of halo2 in the future still have the same opening base \\(\zeta_1\\) for all queries to multiopen. If not, this approach might not work. An implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/han0110/halo2/blob/feature%2Fbarycentric-for-r/halo2_proofs/src/poly/multiopen/shplonk/verifier.rs#L60-L99).

In SHPLONK, the verifier needs to calculate interpolation \\(r(\zeta_{2})\\) from rotation set \\(R\\) and their claimed evaluation value \\(\{y_j\}_{j\in[k]}\\).

One of the largest benefit of barycentric formula is pre-computed barycentric weight. Although \\(R\\) contains different values in each proof, we can still pre-compute the normalized barycentric weight without \\(\zeta_1\\), to gain the benefit.

$$
w_j = \frac{1}{\prod_{i=0,i\ne j}^k(\omega_j-\omega_i)}
$$

And for each rotation set, the actual work is 

$$
w_j^\prime = \frac{w_j}{\zeta_1^{k-1} * (\zeta_2 - \zeta_1\omega_j)}
$$

Also each rotation set might contain more than one polynomials, for each polynomial, its work is

$$
r(\zeta_2) = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^kw_j^\prime y_j}{\sum_{j=0}^kw_j^\prime}
$$

Where the denominator for one set only needs to be calcuated once.

#### Interpolation of public inputs

All lagrange basis could be rotated from the $\ell_0(X) = \frac{X^n-1}{n(X-1)}$

$$
\ell_i(X) = \ell_0(X\omega^{-i}) = \frac{X^n-1}{n(X\omega^{-i}-1)}
$$

Given \\(m\\) public inputs \\(p\\), the interpolation at \\(\zeta\\) is

$$
p(\zeta) = \sum_{i\in[m]}p_i\ell_i(\zeta) = \frac{\zeta^n-1}{n}\sum_{i\in[m]}\frac{p_i}{(\zeta\omega^{-i}) - 1}
$$

Note that \\(\frac{\zeta^n-1}{n}\\) needs \\(\log_2(n)\\) squaring of \\(\zeta\\) with a substraction and a division.

And each extra public input costs about 4 operations (mul + sub + div + add).

## Random thoughts

### Use multi-layer recursive proof for ZKEVM

In our case, we have split ZKEVM into different pieces, with some dependency relation in between.

Fortunately, the dependency relation currently is always being like: One verified circuit serves itself as a lookup table for another. For example, once State circuit is verified to satasify its own relation, then we can synthesize its columns to be a lookup table for EVM circuit to do random access.

Serving self as a lookup table only needs to pass a single check, that is the table commitment(s) (random linearly combined or not). And the difference between fixed table and such verified private table is: The former is built when setup so it is already trusted, the latter is verified for each proof instance and is trusted as long as the relation is well-defined.

So, if a single recursive circuit can't aggregate all different circuits in ZKEVM, we can incrementally aggregate them, and only expose the verified private table's commitment(s) as public input, for next proofs' aggregation.

> If we can have some kinds of "global randomness", we can do vector table's random linear combination first, then the extra public input for exposing verified private table is just a single group element (4 values in rns).
